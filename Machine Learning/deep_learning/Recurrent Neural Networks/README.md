# Recurrent Neural Networks ( LSTM) - Image and Speech Recognition

The main goal of the project is to train the best LSTM neural network and compare it with stanrdard method taking into account raw data features. The input data was from kaggle's speech recognition challenge -- https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data .

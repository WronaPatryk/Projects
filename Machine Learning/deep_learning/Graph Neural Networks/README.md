# Graph Neural Networks - Machine Learning on Graphs

The main goal of the project is to train the best Graph Neural Network  ( GraphSAGE) and compare its performance with a recurrent neural network -- LSTM. Moreover feature engineering; that is using spectrograms or the spectral clustering, was investigated. The input data was from kaggle's speech recognition challenge -- https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data .
